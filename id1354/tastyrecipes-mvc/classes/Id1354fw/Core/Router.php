     * Calls the <code>execute</code> method in the request handler that corresponds to the 
     * specified url. The algorithm to find the request handler is as follows.
     * 1. Remove protocol, server and port from the specified url.
     * 2. Remove http query strings from the string returned by step one.
     * 3. Remove the trailing slash, if there is one, from the string returned by step two.
     * 4. Remove the context path from the string returned by step three. The context path is the part 
     *    between the file system path to the server's root directory and the file system path to a 
     *    file in the web application's root directory.
     * 5. The string returned by step four is the fully qualified name of the request handler to use.
     * 6. If there is no matching class, or if the string in step 5 is 'index.php', use any class 
     *    called <code>DefaultView</code>, in any directory in any level under the 
     *    <code>classes</code> directory.
     * 7. If there still is no matching class, return a HTTP 404 response.
     * 
     * Example:
     * The uri <code>http://server/contextPath/Myapp/View/SomeView</code> will be resolved to the 
     * class <code>\MyApp\View\SomeView</code> located in the file 
     * <code>classes/Myapp/View/SomeView.php</code>
